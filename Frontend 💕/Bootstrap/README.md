# Bootstrap

## 📌 What is Bootstrap?
Bootstrap is a **free, open-source front-end framework** used to build **responsive, mobile-first websites and web applications** quickly and easily.  
It provides ready-made **CSS styles, UI components, grid system, and JavaScript plugins**, so developers don’t have to write everything from scratch.

Bootstrap was originally developed by **Twitter** and is now maintained by the open-source community.
